Hello g88.  Here, let's store toy problems to solve as a group.  

Want everyone in g88 to solve a particular toy problem?

Submit your suggested toy problem.

From everyone's submission, I will choose the most instructive toy problems.  Those we'll solve as a group.

## Template
To submit your toy problem, please follow template.js's example.  Best is to name your js file after the toy problem's name.

Commit your toy problems to the correct directory!  Please with cheese. ðŸ§€

### Template's Goal:
